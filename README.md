#Installation project#

This project is simply a way for me to keep all my config files and stuff
in one place and keep them updated and easily reachable.

Nothing more irritating than forgetting how to install something that
youve spent quite alot of time figuring out how to install some time ago
then everything breaks and you forgot how to do it or that tiny stupid
command in some obscure guide somewhere that magically fixed everything
is nowhere to be seen.
